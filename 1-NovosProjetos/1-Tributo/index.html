                XG (acronym for Xtraordinary Girls) is a Japanese girl group based in South Korea. The group was formed by Xgalx, a subsidiary of Avex.
                The group is composed of seven members: Jurin, Chisa, Hinata, Juria, Cocona, Maya, and Harvey. They made their debut on March 18, 2022, with the release of the digital single "Tippy Toes".

                XG's social media accounts were launched on January 25, 2022, with a short video entitled Xgalx – The Beginning.
                The video showed several girls in training for the Xgalx Project. This was followed by a dance performance video directed by Choi Hyo-jin, of the Korean street dance TV show Street Woman Fighter.
                Over the next few weeks, the group released a series of teaser content, including a rap video featuring Jurin and Harvey performing a cover of Rob Stone's "Chill Bill", and a vocal cover video of Justin Bieber's "Peaches", performed by Juria and Chisa.
                On February 2, XG posted solo dance performance videos, with each member dancing in different styles.
